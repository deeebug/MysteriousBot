Welcome to MysteriousBot!
	Version: 1.0-ALPHA2
	Released: 6/3/2011

====

It's just another IRC Bot, that tries to do a ton of things.
Currently, you can connect to an IRC network via two ways:
	[*] IRC Client - Your simulating a client
	[*] IRC Linked Server- Your linking to the server, like IRC Services

You can also connect to XMPP

====

There is also plugins. Here are some basics to them:
	[*] Namespace must be "Plugins"
	[*] You must "use" Mysterious\Bot\Plugin
	[*] Put your commands you wish to register in a function called "__initialize"

Basic overview of how to register a command:
	[*] $this->register_event('irc.privmsg', '!example', 'cmd_example');
		[*] First paramater is the event. It will be irc.EVENT. Event can be a number, or it can be the action (PRIVMSG, CTCP, NOTICE)
		[*] Second paramater is the command itself. It will be converted into a regex like this: "/^{THECOMMAND}/"
		[*] The third paramater is the function.
	
	[*] $this->register_event('irc.privmsg', '/^!example/', 'cmd_example');
		[*] First paramater is the same as the first example
		[*] Second paramater is now the regex. You can put any regex you wish here
		[*] Third paramater is still, the function
	
	[*] $this->register_event('irc.privmsg', 'catchall');
		[*] First paramater is the same as the first and second example
		[*] Second parameter is a function name.
	
	[*] $this->register_event('irc.privmsg.channel', '!hello', 'cmd_hello');
		[*] First paramater has changed here. On ONLY PRIVATE MESSAGE COMMANDS (PRIVMSG) you can add a following ".channel" for a message only in the channel,
		or ".private" for a Private bot-to-user message.
		[*] Second paramater is the command. Again, can also be like example #2 paramater #2.
		[*] Third paramater, like before, is the function name.

Communicating inside Plugins:
	[*] $this->privmsg($to, $message)
		[*] IRC Private Message.
	
	[*] $this->notice($to, $message)
		[*] IRC Notice
	
	[*] $this->ctcp($to, $message)
		[*] CTCP Notice
	
	[*] $this->join($channel, $key*)
		[*] Join a channel, and if a key is given, with the key.
		[**] NOTE: If the client type is a Server (Linked to an IRCD), then there is NO KEY PARAMATER. Do not pass anything.
	
	[*] $this->part($channel, $message)
		[*] Parts a channel

To access parts of a message inside a plugin, first use "Mysterious\Bot\Message"
Next: To access the information, follow the format:
Message::DATA()
	Where "DATA" would be:
		- channel
		- nick
		- ident
		- host
		- fullhost
		- message
		- args (every word in the message)
		- command (would be PRIVMSG/NOTICE/the numeric

====
Socket Server:
	There is a socket server functionality built into MysteriousBot. You can access, i.e. send messages, or control the bot from it
	An example is located in the misc/socket_test.php file.
====
XMPP:
	Plugins go inside the xmpp_plugins directory (or where ever you put it in the config file)
	
	Plugins MUST extend Mysterious\Bot\XMPP\Plugin;
	Plugins MUST have the var $data. EX: "private $data;"
	To register a command, it's simple. Run this inside a __initialize() function:
		- $this->register_command(COMMAND OR REGEX (SEE IRC Commands), function)
	
	When the command happens, you can get various information about the message in the data array ($this->data)
	To respond:
		$this->respond(text)
	- or-
		$this->message(to, message)

- debug
